## Summary
This project is a complete Music App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a dynamic product catalog with visually appealing product cards that display song details like the song name, artist image, year, and duration. The app allows users to interact with the song database through filtering options and a responsive layout using Flexbox or CSS Grid.

In addition to the product catalog, the app features HTML forms to enhance user interaction, including a Newsletter Sign-Up Form and a Request New Artist Form. The forms include client-side validation and dynamically generated fields. The newsletter form allows users to subscribe to updates, while the artist request form allows users to suggest new artists, specifying details like artist name, genre, social media URLs, and more.

The app is designed with responsive web design in mind, ensuring usability across different screen sizes, and simulates API submissions using a mock server to post form data.

- HTML Forms: Created multiple forms (newsletter sign-up and artist request) with validation, dynamic fields, and proper use of HTML elements like <input>, <textarea>, datalist, and checkbox.

- API Simulation: Integrated mock server for simulating POST requests to handle form submissions, providing a realistic experience of data interaction.

- User Interaction: Enabled features such as filtering songs, dynamically adding artist suggestions, and subscribing to newsletters with immediate feedback.
